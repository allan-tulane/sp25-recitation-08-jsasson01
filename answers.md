- **1b)**
For heap operations such as removing and inserting the work is log(v) where v is the number of nodes in the heap
Each node is removed and each edge is added to a heap one time and the work of adding them to the dictionary or updating them in the dictionary is constant time
W = |E|log(V) + |V|log(V) is O(((|E|+|V|)log(V) )

For the span each node has to be processed in sequence and since each heap operation is span of log(V) 
S= V*log(V)
